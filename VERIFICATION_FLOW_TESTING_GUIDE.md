### **Test 3: Real-time User Updates**

#### **Setup**
1. Have user with pending manual verification submission
2. Have admin access to approve the submission
3. User should be on a page with verification gate

#### **Steps**
1. **User Side Setup**
   - User should be on `/dashboard/tasks/new` or similar protected page
   - Should see verification gate showing "Manual Upload" option
   - Should have submitted documents for manual review

2. **Admin Approval**
   - Admin goes to `/admin/verification`
   - Finds the user's submission
   - Approves the verification

3. **Verify Real-time Update**
   - User's page should automatically update within 30 seconds
   - Verification gate should disappear
   - User should see the protected content (task posting form, etc.)
   - No page refresh should be required

4. **Test Periodic Refresh**
   - Wait up to 30 seconds if update doesn't happen immediately
   - Check browser console for "Periodic verification status refresh" logs
   - Verify user status updates without manual refresh

#### **Expected Results**
- ‚úÖ User verification status updates automatically
- ‚úÖ Verification gate disappears when user becomes verified
- ‚úÖ No manual page refresh required
- ‚úÖ Periodic refresh works every 30 seconds

### **Test 4: Emergency Bypass System**

#### **Setup**
1. Have admin access to `/admin/users`
2. Have user with pending verification issues

#### **Steps**
1. **Access User Management**
   - Go to `/admin/users`
   - Find user with verification issues

2. **Test Emergency Bypass**
   - Click dropdown menu for user
   - Click "üö® Bypass Dojah (Emergency)"
   - Confirm the action

3. **Verify Bypass Results**
   - User's `dojah_verified` should be set to `true`
   - User's `verification_type` should be set to `manual_admin_override`
   - User should immediately have full access

4. **Test User Experience**
   - User should see verification gate disappear
   - Should have access to all features immediately
   - No waiting period required

#### **Expected Results**
- ‚úÖ Emergency bypass works instantly
- ‚úÖ User gets immediate full access
- ‚úÖ Audit trail is maintained

### **Test 5: Verification Gate Behavior**

#### **Setup**
1. Test with different user verification states
2. Use various protected pages

#### **Steps**
